# Governance

## FreeBSD
* Mission
  * The FreeBSD Project's mission can be found at this [webpage](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/history.html#:~:text=We%20believe%20that%20our%20first,provides%20the%20widest%20possible%20benefit.)
* Non-technical & Technical Governance
  * [FreeBSD Foundation](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org) is a 501(c)(3) that supports and promotes FreeBSD, purchases hardware, funds development, advocates at conferences, and legally represents the project.
  * Technical responsibility is delegated to [Teams](https://www.freebsd.org/administration.html), with the "[FreeBSD Core Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD#Governance_structure)" deciding overall goals and direction.  There are over 26 teams.  Every two years the FreeBSD committers select the 9-member FreeBSD Core Team.
  * The FreeBSD Project is run by around 500 committers or developers who have commit access to the master source code repositories and can develop, debug or enhance any part of the system. Most of the developers are volunteers and few developers are paid by some companies. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and website authors) and ports (third-party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD Core Team, which is responsible for overall project direction, setting and enforcing project rules and approving new committers, or the granting of SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, for example, responsibility for managing the ports collection is delegated to the Ports Management Team.
In addition to developers, FreeBSD has thousands of "contributors". Contributors are also volunteers outside of the FreeBSD project who submit patches for consideration by committers, as they don't have direct access to FreeBSD's source code repository. Committers then evaluate contributors' submissions and decide what to accept and what to reject. A contributor who submits high-quality patches is often asked to become a committer.
* Key Players
  * FreeBSD Foundation's current president and founder is Justin Gibbs.  Current Executive Director is Deb Goodkin.

* Non-technical & Technical Governance
  * [Project Governance](https://nodejs.org/en/about/governance/)
  * [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is a 501(c)(6) that provides certification, hosting, funding, and non-technical governance for Javascript projects.  Node.js Foundation and JS Foundation Merge to Form OpenJS Foundation (https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/03/node-js-foundation-and-js-foundation-merge-to-form-openjs-foundation/)
  * Technical governance: partially by a [Cross Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) for requirements applicable to all OpenJS projects and partially by the project itself.
  * Node.js uses a [Consensus Seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) decision making model for internal governance.
  * The code is maintained by Collaborators, with technical direction from a [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) (TSC).
  * The [Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/) focuses on community-facing efforts.
* Key Players
  * OpenJS Foundation [Board of Directors](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) appoints the Executive Director (currently Robin Ginn).
  * OpenJS [Cross Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) provides technical governance across all OpenJS projects.  Current chairperson is Joe Sepi.
  * [Members](https://openjsf.org/about/members/) provide financial support and (at some levels) get a voice on the OpenJSF Board of Directors
  * List of [TSC members](https://github.com/nodejs/node#tsc-technical-steering-committee).
* Governance Artifacts
  * [Guidelines](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/PROJECT_PROGRESSION.md) for joining the foundation.

  * A [certification](https://openjsf.org/certification/) process.
  
## Exercism

* Mission
  * Exercism is a community around building coding skills categorized by language. Members can be both contributors and consumers of the shared works. More info available on their [website](https://exercism.io/about)
* Non-technical & Technical Governance
  * Is governed by an independent not-for-profit [organization](https://exercism.io/about) with a relatively small staff.  They curate a community of supporters through roles (mentor, track maintainers, and coders) and documented policies.
  * Company [Leadership](https://exercism.io/team/staff)
  * [Path to maintainer](https://exercism.io/become-a-maintainer)

## RiscV

* Mission
  * RiscV is interesting in that it doesn't seem to as explicitly as other groups set a vision and mission. It does however elaborate on its history on this [webpage](https://riscv.org/risc-v-history/)
* Non-technical & Technical Governance
  * Leadership is through elected and delegated individuals serving on the RISC-V Board of Directors and the RISC-V Technical Steering Committee (TSC).], Several admin staff sourced through an arrangement with LF.
  * The RISC-V Foundation actively promotes use of a single repository and a compliance verification tool. Its rules of governance support the development of a growing and active ecosystem.
  * The RISC-V Foundation protects the ISA using a trademark and guarantees compatibility within the development community.
  * The RISC-V Foundation is creating certification schemes for individuals working with RISC-V and compliance tools so users can claim their processor is a RISC-V processor.
  * RISC-V Foundation has established clear reciprocal obligations for members that contribute to the design of the core architecture. To become a foundation member, organizations must agree that they will not sue each other on the core instructions; if they do, the RISC-V Foundation will sanction them, and they will lose their right to use the core instructions.
* Key Players
  * [International Board of Directors & Executive Staff](https://riscv.org/leadership/), current chair Krste Asanovic, current CEO is Calista Redmond.
  * [Ambassadors](https://riscv.org/risc-v-ambassadors/) are individuals passionate about RISC-V that are empowered as community representatives.
  * [Members](https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/) provide financial support and highest levels earn seat on the Board. The Foundation has a multi-tier membership with a limited number of platinum members that can influence the standard. Other members of the RISC-V ecosystem can support the RISC-V Foundation and its associated projects; they can also contribute RISC-V extensions and share their industry knowledge and experience with other ecosystem members.
  * RISC-V Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
  * RISC-V Technical Task Group Chairs
  * Japan community special interest group
  * China Advisory Committee
* Governance Artifacts
