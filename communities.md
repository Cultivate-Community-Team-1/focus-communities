# RiscV

* Governance
  * Leadership is through elected and delegated individuals serving on the RISC-V Board of Directors and the RISC-V Technical Steering Committee (TSC).], Several admin staff sourced through an arrangement with LF.
  * The RISC-V Foundation actively promotes use of a single repository and a compliance verification tool. Its rules of governance support the development of a growing and active ecosystem.
  * The RISC-V Foundation protects the ISA using a trademark and guarantees compatibility within the development community.
  * The RISC-V Foundation is creating certification schemes for individuals working with RISC-V and compliance tools so users can claim their processor is a RISC-V processor.
  * RISC-V Foundation has established clear reciprocal obligations for members that contribute to the design of the core architecture. To become a foundation member, organizations must agree that they will not sue each other on the core instructions; if they do, the RISC-V Foundation will sanction them, and they will lose their right to use the core instructions.
* Key Players
  * [International Board of Directors & Executive Staff](https://riscv.org/leadership/), current chair Krste Asanovic, current CEO is Calista Redmond.
  * [Ambassadors](https://riscv.org/risc-v-ambassadors/) are individuals passionate about RISC-V that are empowered as community representatives.
  * [Members](https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/) provide financial support and highest levels earn seat on the Board. The Foundation has a multi-tier membership with a limited number of platinum members that can influence the standard. Other members of the RISC-V ecosystem can support the RISC-V Foundation and its associated projects; they can also contribute RISC-V extensions and share their industry knowledge and experience with other ecosystem members.
