  * Technical responsibility is delegated to [Teams](https://www.freebsd.org/administration.html), with the "Core Team" deciding overall goals and direction.  There are over 26 teams.  Every two years the FreeBSD committers select the 9-member FreeBSD Core Team.
* Key Players
  * FreeBSD Foundation's current president and founder is Justin Gibbs.  Current Executive Director is Deb Goodkin.
  * Numerous technical key players, primarily the liaisons listed under [administration](https://www.freebsd.org/administration.html).
