# Pattterns in Open Source Communities

## Goal
Across all teams, identify and describe patterns in open source communities.

## Tasks
- Across all project teams and from looking at your own and other teamsâ€™ communities, identify and describe patterns. When you notice a community is breaking a pattern, describe it and look for explanations for why the community falls outside the pattern.
- Coordinate within your team and with other teams the collection and description of patterns.

## Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Communities exhibiting the pattern |
| :-----: | :-----:     | :-----:                            |
