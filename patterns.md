# Patterns in Open Source Communities

## Goal
Across all teams, identify and describe patterns in open source communities.

## Tasks
- Across all project teams and from looking at your own and other teamsâ€™ communities, identify and describe patterns. When you notice a community is breaking a pattern, describe it and look for explanations for why the community falls outside the pattern.
- Coordinate within your team and with other teams the collection and description of patterns.

## Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Communities exhibiting the pattern | Communities that break the pattern and why | 
| :-----: | :-----:     | :-----:                            | :-----:                                    |
| Separation of leadership | Several communities there is a distinction made between those who are responsible for technical direction and those who are responsible for community guidelines, legal, financial, etc.  | FreeBSD (FreeBSD Foundation vs Technical Core and sub teams), node.js (OpenJS Foundation vs Cross Project Council & Technical Steering Committee), Exercism.io (Staff vs maintainers), RiscV (Board of Directors vs Technical Steering Committee) | PostgreSQL was the only community I found that broke the pattern. They appear to outsource the non-technical (financial and other admin) to [spi inc.](http://www.spi-inc.org/) This may be due to the fact that the community did not want to establish their own by-laws and non-technical leadership team. | 
| Multiple community platforms | All communities researched were found to each have multiple platforms in active use for community interaction. Often they were organized for use based on subject matter. ie: Slack for discussions, GitHub Issues for bug reports, and Medium for publications. | FreeBSD, NodeJS, Exercism, RiscV | Interestingly a select number of communities had multiple platforms for a single subject such as using IRC and Slack for general discussion such as NodeJS.  Slack seemed fairly active with recent content. It may be that IRC was previously used or is utilized for more direct 1:1 communications. |
| Extensively documented | Software projects and open source projects in particular often come with varying levels of documentation, often with little to no documentation whatsoever. | All of the communities we researched were very well documented.  Their documentation was easily located, in abundance, and readily available. |
| Community source hosting | Projects have a choice of utilizing a shared public source hosting (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, etc.) or self-hosting on their own infrastructure. | Nearly all projects utilize community source hosting including NodeJS, Exercism, RiscV, and Express.js | FreeBSD and PostgreSQL self-host.  FreeBSD appears to have a culture of independent development and keeping infrastructure simple.  They also have a significant contingent of veteran developers that appear to resist change (e.g., using CVS until 2012).  PostgreSQL provides a mirror of their sources on GitHub, so self-hosting appears to be more largely influenced by development control. |
| Contributor roles | Some projects define roles for contributors and have customized on-boarding documentation specific to them.  These are sometimes characterized as teams when/after they are considered members of the project. | FreeBSD, RiscV, exercism, express.js, and PostgreSQL all appear to provide specific role-based on-boarding. | node.js does not appear to describe different roles, but does describe member escalation for code contributors.  A contributor can become promoted to a collaborator whereby they obtain heightened access. |
| Archetypes | Using the Mozilla descriptions the structure of the organizations vary| FreeBSD, PostgreSQL are more "wide open" organizations.  |RiscV tends to have a multi vendors structure while Exercism almost takes on a "rocket ship" personality. |
| Financial Model | How are these organizations funded? | RiscV and nodeJS (OpenJS) is membership is fee based from a large number of vendors. FreeBSD and PostgreSQL relies more on donations|. Exercism is supported by 3 key entities (Mozilla, Alfred Sloane Foundation and Thalamus)|
