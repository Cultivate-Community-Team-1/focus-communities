# Patterns in Open Source Communities

## Goal
Across all teams, identify and describe patterns in open source communities.

## Tasks
- Across all project teams and from looking at your own and other teamsâ€™ communities, identify and describe patterns. When you notice a community is breaking a pattern, describe it and look for explanations for why the community falls outside the pattern.
- Coordinate within your team and with other teams the collection and description of patterns.

## Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Communities exhibiting the pattern | Communities that break the pattern and why | 
| :-----: | :-----:     | :-----:                            | :-----:                                    |
| Separation of leadership | Several communities there is a distinction made between those who are responsible for technical direction and those who are responsible for community guidelines, legal, financial, etc.  | FreeBSD (FreeBSD Foundation vs Technical Core and sub teams), node.js (OpenJS Foundation vs Cross Project Council & Technical Steering Committee), Exercism.io (Staff vs maintainers), RiscV (Board of Directors vs Technical Steering Commmittee) | PostgreSQL was the only community I found that broke the pattern. They appear to outsource the non-technical (financial and other admin) to [spi inc.](http://www.spi-inc.org/) This may be due to the fact that the community did not want to establish their own by-laws and non-technical leadership team. | 
| Multiple community platforms | All communities researched were found to each have mutiple platforms in active use for community interaction. Often they were organized for use based on subject matter. ie: Slack for discussions, GitHub Issues for bug reports, and Medium for publications. | FreeBSD, NodeJS, Exercism, RiscV | Interestingly a select number of communities had multiple platforms for a single subject such as using IRC and Slack for general discussion such as NodeJS.  Slack seemed fairly active with recent content. It may be that IRC was previously used or is utilized for more direct 1:1 communications. |
| Extensively documented | Software projects and open source projects in particular often come with varying levels of documentation, often with little to no documentation whatsoever. | All of the communities we researched were very well documented.  Their documntation was easily located, in abundanc, and readily available. |
